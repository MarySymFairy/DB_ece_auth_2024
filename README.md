# Database-Project in ECE AUTH

## 9th Semester, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 2024-2025

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub. This repository contains a full-stack application built using React for the frontend and Node.js (Express.js) for the backend, leveraging a database for data management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** You can download Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). npm usually comes bundled with Node.js.
*   **Git:** To clone the repository. If you don't have it, download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).
*   **Database configuration:**  The application is set up to be used with a database. If you plan to run your own database you should install:
   *   *   **MySQL:** It will require you to install a MySQL server and client tools. You can download MySQL Community Edition from [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).  You can use MySQL Workbench or another client.

## Execution Instructions

Follow these steps to run the application:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to where you'd like to clone the project, then run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarySymFairy/NeurosyncDB.git
   cd NeurosyncDB
   ```

### 2. Database Configuration
*   **Local Database:** To set up a local MySQL instance:
        *   Ensure you have a MySQL server installed and running.
        *   Create a database named `my_db` (change the name if you like). You can use MySQL Workbench or the `mysql` command-line client, or another database management tool.
        *   **VERY IMPORTANT:** Make sure to create an .env file containing your sensitive data, according to .env.example, to connect your DB to the project.
    Replace the placeholder values with your actual database credentials.  **Do not commit the .env file to your repository!** It contains sensitive information. Note that `DB_PORT` is typically `3306` for MySQL.  I have also added a dump file of the DB we constructed with the use of MySQLWorkbench. (dbsql.sql)

### 3. Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
